# Multithreading in C: Algorithm Selection and Implementation

## Suggested Algorithms for Multithreading

### Sorting Algorithms
- Merge Sort: Divide the array into halves and sort each half in separate threads.
- Quick Sort: Partition the array and sort each partition concurrently.

### Matrix Operations
- Matrix Multiplication: Assign subsets of the resulting matrix to different threads.
- Strassen's Algorithm: Divide the problem into smaller subproblems for concurrent execution.

### Graph Algorithms
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Use multi-thread traversal for different levels.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Parallel relaxation of edges in each step.

### Dynamic Programming
- Fibonacci Sequence: Divide the recursion tree across threads.
- Matrix Chain Multiplication: Perform parallel computation of sub-matrix products.

### Number Theory
- Prime Number Generation (Sieve of Eratosthenes): Divide the range into smaller chunks for parallel processing.
- Modular Exponentiation: Parallelize power calculations for large bases and exponents.

### String Algorithms
- Substring Search (e.g., KMP, Rabin-Karp): Divide the input text into chunks and search concurrently.

### Search Algorithms
- Backtracking Problems: Explore different branches of the solution tree concurrently (e.g., Sudoku solver).
- Binary Search: Perform parallel searches in disjoint subarrays.

## Suggested Order of Implementation

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Start with Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
2. **Matrix Operations**: Implement parallel matrix multiplication as a classic multithreading problem.
3. **Graph Algorithms**: Work on BFS and Dijkstra's algorithms for practice with shared data structures.
4. **Dynamic Programming**: Begin with parallel Fibonacci computation before tackling complex problems like matrix chain multiplication.
5. **Number Theory and String Algorithms**: Scale implementations to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Notes for Implementation

- Use threading libraries like **pthread** or **OpenMP** for parallel execution in C.
- Address potential challenges:
  - **Race Conditions**: Protect shared resources using mutexes or locks.
  - **Load Balancing**: Divide work evenly among threads to maximize CPU usage.
  - **Overhead**: Ensure thread management overhead does not negate performance gains.
